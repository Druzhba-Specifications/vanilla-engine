To set up your game version is really easy. You only have to fill our these fields:
vername, major, minor, and subminor.
For example, Release 1.4.3 would be as such:

{
    "gamever":[
        {
        "vername": "Release", 
        "major":"1",
        "minor": "4",
        "subrelease": "4"
        }
    ]
}

And there you have it.
